**Cyclone-Shaheen-Oman-2021** (ongoing-project)

IBFWS (Impact Based Forecast and Warning System) based data and analysis related to the impacts of Cyclone Shaheen in Oman: SAR, rainfall, flood mapping and documentation.”
Cyclone Shaheen 2021 – Flood Impact Assessment (Oman)

This repository documents the workflow, scripts, and outputs for assessing the **flood impacts of Cyclone Shaheen (Oct 2021)** in Oman.  
The project integrates **satellite remote sensing, rainfall analysis, and hydrologic/hydraulic modelling** to generate hazard and exposure layers aligned with an **Impact-Based Forecast and Warning System (IBFWS)** approach.


Objectives
- Map rainfall intensity and accumulation using **IMERG (GPM)** satellite data (30 Sep–5 Oct 2021).
- Derive flood extent from **Sentinel-1 SAR** imagery (post-event residual flooding).
- Set up hydrologic modelling (**HEC-HMS**) to transform rainfall into runoff.
- Run 2D hydraulic simulations (**HEC-RAS 2D**) to reconstruct peak inundation.
- Overlay exposure data (population, infrastructure) to identify high-risk zones.
- Provide open and reproducible workflows for flood risk assessment in data-scarce regions.
